# Basic Monitoring, Logging, Security, and Access Control 
Hereâ€™s content and image descriptions for the new topics to help you prepare your presentation on OpenShift monitoring, logging, security best practices, and access control policies.

### 1. **Monitoring Applications in OpenShift**

Monitoring is essential for ensuring the health and performance of applications in OpenShift. OpenShift uses **Prometheus** for monitoring, and **Grafana** for visualization, with **Alertmanager** handling alerts.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from applications and system components, stores them, and triggers alerts.
- **Grafana**: Provides dashboards for visualizing metrics.
- **Alertmanager**: Sends alerts to different channels (email, Slack, etc.) when issues arise.

### 2. **Logging in OpenShift**

Logging is crucial for tracking application behavior and troubleshooting issues. OpenShift uses **ElasticSearch**, **Fluentd**, and **Kibana (EFK)** for its logging stack.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Fluentd**: Collects logs from nodes and forwards them to ElasticSearch.
- **ElasticSearch**: Stores and indexes log data.
- **Kibana**: Visualizes log data and helps in querying logs.

### 3. **Security Best Practices in OpenShift**

Security is a critical aspect of managing OpenShift clusters, and there are several best practices to follow to ensure a secure environment.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures users have the right level of access to resources.
- **Network Policies**: Control how pods communicate with each other and external systems.
- **Image Security**: Use trusted images and scan them for vulnerabilities regularly.

### 4. **Access Control Policies and Practices**

Access control ensures that only authorized users and applications can interact with OpenShift resources.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Controls access based on roles and permissions.
- **OAuth and Identity Providers**: OpenShift integrates with OAuth for managing user access.
- **ServiceAccounts**: Special accounts for pods and services to control their access to resources.
